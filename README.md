## Team Profile Generator

## Description
This is a node application that allows you to answer prompts in order to keep track of everyone on your team including managers, engineers and interns. Each one asks for different information including name, email, id, etc. Once you finish entering everyone on the team, you press "All memebers are entered" and it will create an html file that will update once the prompts have been completed.
